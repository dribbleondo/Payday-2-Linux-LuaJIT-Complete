# Payday-2-Linux-LuaJIT-Decrypted
 Decrypted Linux files
 
 Don't expect this to be updated all the time. This is mostly for my curiosity/ your amusement.
 
 Crimenetmanager.lua, due to weird slot decryption errors, is partially inconsistent with the real file.
 There are genuine differences however, which I have attempted to keep where my sanity could be spared while
 manually editing it to replace the slots with their intended functions. This was not easy for someone who only
 has a vague understanding of lua, so apologies to any lua coder looking at this and shaking their head in shame.
 
 Thanks to steam-test1 for helping me with decrypting this nonsense, and anyone else who i've missed.
 
 Currently up to date to Update 232.3
